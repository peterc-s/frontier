# Frontier [WIP]
## The Idea
Whilst distro-hopping I realised how annoying it was re-installing all my packages, especially when I keep forgetting about what I had installed.
The goal is to have a configuration stored in a TOML file that can be installed with a single command.

## Todo:
- [ ] get things working ([feature branch](https://github.com/peterc-s/frontier/tree/setup))
- [ ] design a good format for the TOML
- [ ] install packages with the specified package manager in the TOML
- [ ] support for common package managers
- [ ] add some method to configure things (i.e. import dotfiles from a github repo or folder)
