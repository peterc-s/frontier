# Frontier [WIP]
## The Idea
Whilst distro-hopping I realised how annoying it was re-installing all my packages, especially when I keep forgetting about what I had installed.
The goal is to have a configuration stored in a TOML file that can be installed with a single command.

## Todo:
- [x] get things working
- [x] install packages with the specified package manager in the TOML
- [x] base logic to generate TOML files from current packages
- [ ] support for common package managers
- [ ] add some method to configure things (i.e. import dotfiles from a github repo or folder)
